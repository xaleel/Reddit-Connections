# Reddit Connections

This is a Reddit app/game where you follow a path from a starting subreddit to the goal one, going through links of posts, users, and other subreddits.

## How to play

_There is a short tutorial in the game itself_ but here's an overview:

-   There are 3 types of screens you see:
    -   Subreddit
    -   Post comments
    -   User submissions
-   When on a subreddit, you see the top 4 posts of the day. You can click on any of them to navigate to that post.
-   You'd then be able to see 5 random comments from that post. You can click on a username to navigate to the user
-   On a user's page, you can see 5 of their latest posts and comments. Clicking on any will take you to the subreddit it was submitted in, and you continue from step 2.
-   The goal is to reach the goal subreddit (seen in the top right corner) in as fewer steps as possible. Each link click counts as a step.
-   Got stuck in a loop? You have 3 lifelines in each attempt. A lifeline can be used to either go back one step, or go to a random subreddit
-   Clicking on a post that has no comments or clicking on `[deleted]` user will take you to a random subreddit
-   NSFW post previews are **not shown**
